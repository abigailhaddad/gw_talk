    "### Benefits of Using Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "* Easier to understand: Functions allow you to break your code into smaller, more manageable pieces. This makes it easier for you (and others) to understand what your code is doing.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Avoiding side effects: A side effect is when a function changes something you didn't mean for it to change. This can make code hard to reason about and introduce bugs. By using functions that only depend on their inputs and only modify the variables that you're returning explicitly as outputs, you can avoid side effects and make your code more predictable.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Modularity: Functions let you organize your code into modular pieces. This means that you can easily rearrange or reuse parts of your code without affecting the rest of the program.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Reusability: Well-written functions can be easily reused in other parts of your code or even in other projects, saving time and ensuring consistent results. It also means that if you modify how a function works - for instance, replacing a loop with list comprehension in Python - you only need to change it in one place, not every place you're calling it."

    "## Structuring a Function\n",
    "\n",
    "In both Python and R, a function is defined by a name, a set of input parameters, and a return statement to provide the output. The general structure is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "Python:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def function_name(input1, input2, ...):\n",
    "    # Function logic here\n",

    "\n",
    "1. Keep functions small and focused on a single task.\n",
