# This is for the 8/31 GW coding club talk 

### Topics

* We're going to talk briefly about technical debt, LLMs, and functions and refactoring.

* Then we're going to improve some code. 

* To participate, you'll need to have Python installed (and ideally to be able to run a notebook -- but you can use https://colab.research.google.com/ or another online environment as well.)

* You should also be prepared to use an LLM: you can use ChatGPT, Claude 2, or you can run your own general-purpose or coding-specific LLM.
